== Updating a Highly Available {product-title_short} Environment

Applying software package minor updates (referred to as _errata_) to appliances in a high availability environment must be performed in a specific order to avoid migrating your databases to the next major {product-title_short} version.

.Prerequisites

Ensure each appliance is registered to Red Hat Subscription Manager and subscribed to the update channels required by {product-title_short} in order to access updates.

To verify if your appliance is registered and subscribed to the correct update channels, run:

----
# yum repolist
----

Appliances must be subscribed to the following channels:


* `ansible-2.8-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms`
* `cfme-5.11-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms`
* `rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms`
* `rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms`

If any appliance shows it is not registered or is missing a subscription to
any of these channels, see _Registering and Updating {product-title}_ in
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.5/html-single/general_configuration/[General Configuration] to register and subscribe the appliance.


.Updating the Appliances

Follow this procedure to update appliances in your environment without migrating the database to the next major version of {product-title_short}. Note the appliance to perform each step on: some steps are to be performed only on the database-only appliances, and other steps only on the non-database {product-title_short} appliances, while some steps apply to all appliances.

. Power off the non-database {product-title_short} appliances.
. Power off the database-only appliances.
. Back up each appliance:
.. Back up the database of your appliance. Take a snapshot if possible.
.. Back up the following files for disaster recovery, noting which appliance each comes from:
  * `/var/www/miq/vmdb/GUID`
  * `/var/www/miq/vmdb/REGION`
.. Note the hostnames and IP addresses of each appliance. This information is available on the summary screen of the appliance console.
. Start each database-only appliance.
. Start each non-database {product-title_short} appliance again, and stop `evmserverd` on each just after boot:
+
------
# systemctl stop evmserverd
------
+
. Apply updates by running the following on each appliance:
+
------
# yum update
------
+
. On one of the non-database {product-title_short} appliances, apply any database schema updates included in the errata, and reset the Red Hat and ManageIQ automation domains:
+
------
# vmdb
# rake db:migrate
# rake evm:automate:reset
------
+
. Power off the non-database {product-title_short} appliances.
. Reboot the database-only appliances.
. Wait five minutes, then start the non-database {product-title_short} appliances again.

The appliances in your high availability environment are now up to date.
